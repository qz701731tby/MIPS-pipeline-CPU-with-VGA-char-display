# MIPS-pipeline-CPU-with-VGA-char-display
In this repository, I design a 5-level pipeline CPU and a VGA module to display the information of CPU. 

Our pipepline realize 23 MIPS instructions and are able to run fabonacci, the test file of fabonacci is included in the CPU file.

You can call the VGA IP core directly in the CPU project.
